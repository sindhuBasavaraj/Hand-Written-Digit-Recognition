# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition
This repository contains an implementation of handwritten digit recognition using a deep neural network. The model is trained on a dataset of handwritten digits and can accurately classify new, unseen digits.
# Dataset 
MNIST Dataset
# Features
Deep Neural Network: The core of the project is a deep neural network architecture designed for image classification tasks.
MNIST Dataset: The model is trained on the popular MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).
TensorFlow Implementation: The deep neural network is implemented using TensorFlow, a widely-used open-source machine learning framework.
Training and Evaluation: The repository includes scripts for training the model and evaluating its performance on a separate test set.
